You might not realize, but do you know how many cloud services you are already using? Ranging from the web-based email to data backup and online music, everything is a gift of cloud computing!
Cloud computing is all about delivering services through the internet with the help of data and software solutions without installing on-premise IT infrastructure. That being said, cloud computing can cater to SME-related concerns, and if you are ready to gain deeper insights, shall we dive into details?

## Reduced Costs

When you outsource cloud computing, acquiring and maintaining hardware won’t be your responsibility, saving thousands of bucks. In addition, the companies won’t need to update the on-premise computers since CSP’s resources will be used.

## Flexible Access

When a user profile is created on the cloud, the user can access the profile remotely, irrespective of locations and devices (yup, you can work on the go). Having flexible access to the cloud and data will not only increase productivity levels but motivation as well.

## Convenient Collaborations

The modern workforce is pretty diverse and physically dispersed. Since data will be maintained on a central platform, the business won’t have to worry about distance hindering efficiency. It’s a promising application of cloud computing, particularly when an SME is working on a project which demands real-time collaboration, promising higher coordination and syncing!

## Better Security

When all the data is housed on a central platform, the CSP will provide encryption to ensure it’s secure from cyber threats and data-stealing. On top of everything, an unauthorized person won’t have access to the data, promising the utmost security of sensitive business data.

## Efficient Operations

Whether you outsource cloud solutions or install the on-premise solutions, the servers are used for data storage, and apps will operate on cloud networks for higher productivity. That being said, even if the SME is outmoded, the efficiency won’t be hampered, and employee productivity will be extended beyond workplace boundaries.

## Scalability

If an SME is planning on increasing the operations, they will need to acquire more IT infrastructure to support more people in the workforce. On the other hand, in case of downsizing, the capital expenses spent on acquiring more hardware will be useless. With cloud computing, all a company needs to do is create a new profile on the cloud network in case of new hires.

## Automated Updates

Since apps and data are centrally maintained, performance and security will be dispersed throughout the cloud network. This also means that one update will be sent over the entire network, which takes away the headache of updating every device individually. Not to forget, the company won’t have to hire any full-time IT personnel only for updates!

## Business Continuity

SMEs are vulnerable to economic and political disruptions, which means slight discrepancy will hinder the smooth functionality. With the implementation of cloud computing, SMEs can enjoy unparalleled business continuity at cost-effective rates. In simpler words, cloud computing makes an SME immune to these impacts. Not to forget, the disaster recovery features will promise higher BC during crises.

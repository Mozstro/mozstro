Cloud computing has seen exponential growth, with more and more industries taking their leap into the world of cloud-based solutions. 

With the cloud seeing more and more adoption, it is important to understand the possible implications you and your business may come across when migrating to the cloud. 

This article has been curated through our own experiences here at Mozstro when dealing with the common pain points that arise when in the cloud. 

- Inadequate training

Receiving training on using cloud services is vital for both the individual and the organisation as a whole.

Ensuring that all engineers are informed on the functionalities and best practices is vital for a harmonious experience that reduces further risk. 

Through the correct allocation of funding and time for training, your team will be prepared for further implications.

- Data breaches

Data protection is at the forefront of cloud computing, with many public-sector companies now taking part in [building their digital infrastructure via the cloud](https://www.mozstro.com/projects/registration-service). 

With the strict GDPR laws in the modern age, it is vital you protect sensitive data from any threats.

Having a team rich with experience and assurance will leave your organisation in safe hands. Losing sensitive data due to breaches is harmful for reputations, so always do your due diligence on safety measures put in place to protect data. 

 

- Insecure interfaces and APIs

An API allows the transmission of data from one product to another. As an API is an entry point for your application, it will be the most common vector for cyber attacks.

*“Security pros must specifically build in API security and not assume that it's rolled into their existing web application protections."*  - Sandy Carielli

Implementing adequate security measures on your organisation’s APIs creates a drastic reduction in the chance of any bad actors performing a successful attack.


## Conclusion


Once you have integrated your business into the cloud, it is fundamental that you do not leave it unsecure. Having a strong understanding of what makes your cloud secure environment is important for your infrastructure to remain stable. 

Cyber attacks from cloud infrastructure are bad news for your business. Keeping up to date with operations is the key to avoiding any negative effects such as data breaches causing loss of earnings.

Security best practices to keep in mind when using AWS S3.

## Service overview

Simple storage service or better know as AWS S3. Is a cloud object storage that can be used for many use cases in modern cloud applications.

As more applications start to utilize S3. Heres how to ensure you stay protected.

### Bucket policies and IAM policies

There are two ways to allow access via policies for S3 both use JSON for the policy format.

**Bucket policies** are great for multiple use cases such as:

- Enforcing SSL.
- Enforcing object uploads to be encrypted.
- Require MFA.
- Limit IP addresses.
- Access from multiple AWS accounts.

#### Policy examples

Bucket Policy to enforce TLS / SSL:

```

  "Id": "ExamplePolicy",
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "AllowOnlySSL",
      "Action": "s3:*",
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket",
        "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/*"
      ],
      "Condition": {
        "Bool": {
          "aws:SecureTransport": "false"
        }
      },
      "Principal": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

Bucket policy to enforce SSE-S3 (S3 managed encryption):

```
 {
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Id": "PutObjPolicy",
     "Statement": [
           {
                "Sid": "DenyIncorrectEncryptionHeader",
                "Effect": "Deny",
                "Principal": "*",
                "Action": "s3:PutObject",
                "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/*",
                "Condition": {
                        "StringNotEquals": {
                               "s3:x-amz-server-side-encryption": "AES256"
                         }
                }
           },
           {
                "Sid": "DenyPlaintextUploads",
                "Effect": "Deny",
                "Principal": "*",
                "Action": "s3:PutObject",
                "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/*",
                "Condition": {
                        "Null": {
                               "s3:x-amz-server-side-encryption": true
                        }
               }
           }
     ]
 }
```

**IAM polices** can be added inline to users or attached to roles which can then be assumed by users or AWS services to allow access to S3.

#### Implement least privilege access

With both bucket and user polices a key principal you should refer too is least privilege access.
Which means only give access at the lowest level required.
For example a user only has the actions they need a read only user cannot edit or delete any objects in the bucket only get.

### Public access

When creating a bucket via the AWS console by default the settings are ticked to disable public access to the bucket.

Using IaC this can change for example if your project is using Terraform ensure this is still the case when creating buckets.

The below snippet will block public access for a supplied bucket:

```
resource "aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block" "my_bucket_public_block" {
    bucket = "${aws_s3_bucket.my_bucket.id}"
    block_public_acls = true
    block_public_policy = true
    restrict_public_buckets = true
}
```

### Bucket encryption

**Encryption at rest** is a measure to prevent attackers accessing data on disk. It can be done both at server and client side.

**Server side:**
Request that S3 encrypts the data before saving it to a disk in the data centre.
The data is then decrypted when it is requested for download.

There are 3 ways to encrypt a file within S3:

- S3 managed keys SSE-S3.
- KMS managed keys SSE-KMS.
- Customer managed keys SSE-C.

**Client side:**
The data is already encrypted before being sent to S3 which means you manage the encryption process and keys.

**Encryption in transit** is a measure to prevent attacks such as man in the middle and manipulating network traffic to steal data.

To protect yourself from this ensure you only use HTTPS (TLS). THe bucket policy shown in the Bucket policies and IAM policies section can be used to enforce TLS on a bucket.

### Object lock

Object locking allows you to store objects using the WORM (Write Once Read Many) model and is useful to prevent accidental deletion of data.

### Versioning

Enabling bucket versioning is a must to be able to keep an audit history of object changes and any accidental overwrites of objects.
With versioning enabled you can also enable MFA delete adding an extra layer of security for:

- Changing the versioning state of your bucket.
- Permanently deleting an object version.

### VPC endpoints

A VPC endpoint for S3 is a logical entity that only allows for connectivity to S3.
Instead of opening your S3 bucket to the open internet using VPC endpoints allows you restrict connectivity to just VPCs and VPC endpoints that you allow.

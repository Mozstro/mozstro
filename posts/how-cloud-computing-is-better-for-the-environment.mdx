Cloud computing doesn’t need an introduction – at least not in this tech-savvy world. The benefits of cloud computing are evident, ranging from low investment risks to reduced costs and higher availability to low marketing time. It’s safe to say that these are some benefits that give cloud computing leverage over on-premise computing solutions.
Interestingly but not unexpectedly, cloud computing has positive environmental outcomes that we will discuss in this article. So, let’s move forward!

## Reduction In Energy Consumption

Operating the on-site data center puts a great load on power consumption since it demands a continuous power supply for operating the server and the cooling system. In addition, when the equipment lifecycle meets its end, it needs disposal, resulting in higher e-waste (do you know data centers consume over 1.8% of the US energy consumption?).
With cloud computing, energy consumption is significantly reduced. It’s safe to say that research conducted by the Lawrence Berkeley National University and Northwestern University stated that cloud-based apps and software solutions can cut down energy consumption by 87% (the research was funded by Google). Eventually, the businesses will save 60% to 85% on electric utility bills.

## Reduction In Greenhouse Gas Emissions

Cloud computing can cut down the greenhouse gas emission released from the data centers. A conventional and on-premise computing solution adds to the GHG emission through equipment assembly, raw material production, equipment transportation, and wasted equipment disposal. On the other hand, cloud computing can reduce carbon emissions by reducing energy consumption and requirement.

## Dematerialization

Cloud computing can positively influence the trends of sustainability through dematerialization (substituting high-carbon equipment with virtual options). It helps reduce the carbon footprint and energy consumption. Also, the cloud computing service allows people to utilize virtual services, such as video streamlined as compared to physical equipment.
Migration to cloud computing results in need for fewer hardware and machinery that not only consumes lesser energy but also has a limited impact on the environment. As a result, the organizations shall have a low utility bill and more available capital for funding more profitable ventures/projects. With the reduction of physical products, the waste amount will be emanated.
An additional benefit of cloud computing is the ability of organizations to set paperless standards with the deployment of cloud storage apps. Also, cloud-based technologies eliminate the need for document printing while ensuring secure document storage. Not to forget, the elimination of hard-copy documents will reduce the negative ecological impacts.

## Efficient Data Centers

Sustainability has become an essential matter for business success, and it’s paving the path to attain a low-carbon and eco-friendly society. With cloud computing, business operations are made more efficient as compared to on-premise data centers. As a result, the IT resources are efficiently used, promising better output for the environment.
The primary concept of cloud computing is sharing of services, which maximizes the resource’s effectiveness. The cloud computing data centers are integrated with cutting-edge and energy-efficient technologies. In fact, they use less power conditioning, cooling, and lighting, promising energy saving.

## The Bottom Line

Cloud computing is more than just a convenience and new technology for the business; it encourages sustainability. Honestly, the benefits are too many to ignore when climate change and global warming have become pressing issues!

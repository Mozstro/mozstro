## Project overview

Developed an effective digital signing service for a client in the health sector. MVP focusing on document signing. The project was classed as the highest level in the security risk scale.
Thus everything was built with security at the fore front. Using bleeding edge AWS services working with internal AWS staff to design the best way too implement this service.

We managed to deliver output several times in the 6 month the project was worked on each time providing business value to the client running show and tell sessions to share the outputs.

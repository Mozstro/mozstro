Cloud native despite being a grounded concept within modern software development is still a grey area for devs both new and old.

This article will give you the lowdown on what cloud native is, the pros and cons brought forward by it and what it has to bring in the future.

## Let Me Introduce Myself…

Let’s get straight into it.

‘Cloud-native’ allows organisations to run scalable applications in more up-to-date and dynamic environments. These environments can be on public, private and/or hybrid clouds.

Microservices and declarative APIs are just 2 ways of exemplifying this approach. Techniques such as devops and agile methodology are then brought forward to work hand in hand with the latter, creating high quality solutions.

_To gain a more direct and in-depth definition of Cloud Native we recommend visiting the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/)._

Cloud Native technology allows a modern take on a traditional concept found within Software Development. Traditionally architectures were suited for physical data centres, but thanks to the cloud this new concept has been tailored to build its applications in conjunction with the cloud.  
Some of the first companies to take this approach were Netflix, Airbnb, Spotify & Uber. Those companies are well grounded household names now, which has since birthed the new generation of Cloud Native companies making it somewhat of a norm.

## The Building Blocks

Now that we have an understanding of what Cloud Native is about, it’s time we understand the foundations and landscaping behind this concept.

### The 4 layers are as follows:

#### 1) Application & Definition Layer

This is the top layer that focuses on the tools used to make the applications (databases, messaging systems etc) possible.

#### 2) Provisioning Layer

This secures the environment that will host the application and let it run. This is done in an algorithmic way. Infrastructure is treated like code. Builds are automated, images are stored in repositories whilst also taking into consideration the security needs through authentication tools and vulnerability scanning.

#### 3) Runtime layer

This is focused on how the cloud native application is run. For example the container runtime.

#### 4) Orchestration & Management Layer

This brings together relevant tools needed to deploy, manage and scale the given application. It enables orchestration and scheduling of the application.

The Pros and Cons
There are always pros and cons to consider in the world of tech. It’s important to be aware of them before committing…

### Pros:

#### Fault Tolerant

- One service failing doesn’t impact the whole setup

#### Have Multiple Stacks of Technology

- As long as the technology used can be linked to the same API’s then it is a fully flexible concept

#### Organisation

- If your team is segmented then they are able to focus on their role and expertise. Deployment, testing and scaling of the application can be maximised in this case.

### Cons:

#### Testing

- Testing can be fairly complex due to the different services, due to this they must be integratable.

#### Memory/Storage

- More of this is needed and the increase is inevitable when comparing this to other design structures such as the monolithic approach.

### Conclusion
